# HOW TO FINE TUNE

To fine-tune a language model using Replicate, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Data**: Format your dataset in JSONL, with one example per line. Include input and output fields, such as prompts and completions.
  
2. **Set Up Project**: Use Replicate's platform to upload your data and select a model.

3. **Train the Model**: Start the fine-tuning process. Specify parameters like batch size, learning rate, and epochs.

4. **Monitor Progress**: Track training through the dashboard, reviewing logs and costs.

# JSONL TRAINING DATA

Here’s a step-by-step guide to fine-tune an open-source model on Hugging Face using a JSONL dataset in a zip file. This process ensures your model is fine-tuned and accessible on Hugging Face.

### Step 1: Unzip and Upload Dataset
- Unzip your JSONL file.
- Optionally, upload it to Hugging Face's Dataset Hub or use directly from local storage.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
```

### Step 3: Load Dataset
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files='path/to/your/data.jsonl')
```

### Step 4: Prepare the Model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "your-model"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Step 5: Training Configuration
```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs"
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset['train']
)
```

### Step 6: Train the Model
```python
trainer.train()
```

### Step 7: Save and Upload
```python
trainer.save_model("path_to_save")
```

You can push the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub using:
```bash
huggingface-cli login
huggingface-cli repo create my-model
git push
```

# REPLICATE

To fine-tune a model on Replicate using a dataset uploaded on Hugging Face, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Upload Dataset on Hugging Face
Ensure your dataset is publicly accessible on Hugging Face Datasets.
example https://huggingface.co/datasets/livethelifetv/context

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install replicate transformers datasets
```

### Step 3: Load Dataset from Hugging Face
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset('huggingface/dataset-name')
```

### Step 4: Fine-tune on Replicate
Use Replicate’s API to fine-tune:
```python
import replicate

training = replicate.trainings.create(
    version="your-model-version",
    input={
        "train_data": "URL_to_your_Hugging_Face_dataset",
        "num_train_epochs": 3
    },
    destination="your-replicate-username/your-model"
)
```
example: https://replicate.com/ikigailabseth/ghost

### Step 5: Monitor and Deploy
Track the progress on the Replicate dashboard and use the trained model via the API.
